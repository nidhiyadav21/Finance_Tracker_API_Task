<h1>Personal Finance Tracker API</h1>
 
 Project Overview:-

Personal Finance Tracker is a scalable and modular REST API built using FastAPI and MongoDB to efficiently manage income and expense transactions.
The system is designed with clean architecture principles, asynchronous database operations, structured validation, and real-world financial tracking features such as filtering, bulk operations, and monthly summaries.
This project demonstrates backend development best practices including validation, dependency injection, async programming, and aggregation handling.

**Architecture & Design Approach**
---
The application follows a layered modular architecture:

1)API Layer – Handles routing and HTTP request/response lifecycle.

2)Schema Layer – Data validation using Pydantic models.

3)Core Layer – Configuration and database connection management.

4)Dependency Layer – Reusable dependencies like pagination.

The design ensures:
---
- Separation of concerns.

- Clean and maintainable code.

- Scalable structure for future enhancements.

**Technical Highlights**
---
- Asynchronous API implementation using FastAPI

- Async MongoDB integration via Motor

- Structured request validation using Pydantic

- Dependency Injection for database handling

- MongoDB aggregation for financial summary

- Bulk delete operations with date filtering

- Query-based filtering (category & date range)

- Proper HTTP status codes & exception handling

- Environment-based configuration management

**Internal Request Flow**
---
 1)Client Request: The initial entry point where the user sends data.

 2)FastAPI Router: Receives and directs the request to the appropriate endpoint.

 3)Pydantic Validation: Ensures the incoming data strictly matches the defined schema.

 4)Dependency Injection: Manages and provides required resources, such as database sessions.

 5)Motor (Async MongoDB Driver): Handles the asynchronous connection to the database.

 6)MongoDB Execution: The database performs the requested read or write operation.

 7)Response Serialization: Converts complex Python objects back into a standard format.

 8)Client Receives JSON: The final output is delivered to the user as a JSON payload.
